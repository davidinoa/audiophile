## Tech Stack

The development of this ecommerce site employed a cutting-edge tech stack, emphasizing performance, scalability, and developer efficiency:

- Next.js (React & TypeScript): This combination offers a robust framework for building fast, scalable, and maintainable server-rendered React applications with the added benefits of TypeScript's type safety.
- Tailwind CSS: Utilized for its utility-first approach, Tailwind CSS facilitates rapid UI development, allowing for custom, consistent styling across the platform.
- tRPC with React Query: This setup enables type-safe API routes without the need for manual type definitions or schemas, integrated with React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.
- Prisma: Chosen for its next-generation ORM capabilities for Node.js and TypeScript, Prisma simplifies database access, schema migrations, and data management.
- React Hook Form: Employed for managing forms within the app, React Hook Form enhances the user input gathering process, offering efficient validation and error handling.
- Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, Zod is used for validating data shapes, ensuring robust, type-safe input validation throughout the application.

This architecture was meticulously designed to support the seamless addition of new features and scalability, with a keen focus on maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase for long-term project health.
